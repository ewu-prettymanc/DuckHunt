1) in cheese array.cpp.   I had several warnings about the order in which my
initilzation lists were initilizing members.  SO, I moved them around.
The compilier wanted them in the same order in which they were declared in
the .h file.

Also saw this in ford array.cpp

2) #include "image_array.h" in gravity_sprite.h

3) intro.cpp and main.cpp both have a main.  So, I deleted intro.cpp
with svn delete intro.cpp

4) numerous speeeelling errors 

COMPILED.....

1) background is WAAAAY TOOO big.  So I shrunk back.jpg.

changed the constructor of platformer to use the new width and height. 

2) called base_game::draw() in platform_game::draw()

3) everything is waay damn big, better shrink em
made all moving sprites have a width of 50
changed the platforms to have height of 100

5) make the platforms wider and thinner and put them in different places
   made a pyramid thing.  also changed set_xy in platform_array.cpp
   to use upper left coords, not center coords

6) lincoln moves funny.  maybe set dx instead of inc.   yeah. 
   added set_dx to sprite and called it in platform_game.cpp

7) esc should exit.....
   added to platform_game.cpp


4) cannot seem to jump    // turned off other sprites to isolate
   - changed inc dy to set dy ... only jump when dy is 0
   - cannot jump off of platform
       in gravity_sprite::check_platform, if dy is positive, set it to zero
       if it is negative (ie: jumping ), then let it be negative
   - falls off edge bottom right
       dunno.  
   - cannot jump from the bottom
       made certain that if we don't collide with platforms and at the
       bottom, we don't accelerate
   - does something weird at the top...
       at the top, we now set dy to 0.   
       and set the y coord of the top to zero
   - jumps through platform 
       if we hit the bottom, we move the picture off the platform
       and set gravity in motion.
