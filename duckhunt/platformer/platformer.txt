Description:  We are going to write a platformer.  When the game
starts, it will have three platforms.   One john Mill and three henrey fords.
Ford drives in one direction.  He is spawned randomly from the top.  Ford 
is killed when he is hit by a fish.   He respawns after being dead or if he
runs off the edge.  There will be cheeses that also randomly spawn from the
top.  They drop down and don't move.   They disappear after John walks over 
them.  The game ends when john is run over by ford or if the user quits.
