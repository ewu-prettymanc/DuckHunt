This is going to be a tough project. If you are not careful, you will get screwed by it. 

You are going to write the game duck hunt. 

In particular.....

-When the game starts, the user should see a background that looks a large grassy field beneath a blue sky. Maybe some clouds. 
-At a random interval, perhaps 1-10 seconds, a duck should pop up from the grass and head off to the top of the screen. 
-The duck should take a zig zagging course. 
-The duck should have some animation. Specifally, it should be able to face right or left depending on the direction of travel. 
-If the user clicks on the duck, it dies, and is removed from the screen. Poof. (You might want to check the sdl wiki for 
how to handle mouse events. it is much easier than keyboard events) 
-The game ends when the user selects q or clicks the close button. 

EXTRA CREDIT: 
-better guns! Other weapons. 
-a dog, that occasionally pops up. 
-death effects for the ducks. 
-flapping wings or other animations.

TURN IN: turn this in a new repository on odin. Turn in the command that I will need to check out this repository.
