Greetings. I would like you to write a game over your very own. Create an svn repo for it and upload the command that I would use to check it out. 

Here are the requirements:

1) you must create three new children of existing objects ( not including any you created for the previous project ).
2) You can use any code written in class or from the previous project.
3) Your new program must include either sound or text. If we do not cover this in class, I will provide some sample programs.
4) Your new program must handle keyboard events, mouse motion events, and mouse button down events. 
5) The game must be significantly different from any we have coded in the past. You might consider break out, space invaders, pacman, or any other simple game from the 80's.
